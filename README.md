## Face Mask detection app

Jupyter notebook app for detecting whether or not a person is wearing a face mask.

Based on my graduation thesis and uses the detection model that was built for the thesis.

The thesis deals with training and running the detector on a raspberry Pi platform in order to intergrate the detection algorithm with a smart lock system.

During its creation OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras was used to determine detection and train the model.

The original model was trained on a computer generated data set.
